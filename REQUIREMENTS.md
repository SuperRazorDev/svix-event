# Event Types UI

We're going to build a small UI for managing [Svix event types](https://api.svix.com/docs#tag/Event-Type)

The UI should work with the real Svix API (you can use the Svix JavaScript library for that), though feel free to hardcode the access token (or leave it as a placeholder).

## Requirements

- Work with the real Svix API.
- We want users of the UI to be able to create new event types, list existing ones, update them, and potentially also delete them.
- Open a PR against an empty repository that you create.

## General guidelines

- Please don't spend more than 2-3 hours on this.
- Feel free to use common libraries, tools, and open source software.
- It's OK to skip things if you run out of time, or if you think something is not essential for v1. Just make sure to document these decisions in the pull request.
- Don't try to be fancy, just write code you would normally write when working on a similar task.
- If you don't know or unsure about something, it's fine to say so.
